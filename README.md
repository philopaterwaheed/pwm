- **Center Master Layout**: A layout option where the main window is centered, with other windows tiled around it.
- **Sticky Clients**: Windows can be set as "sticky" so they remain visible across all workspaces **per monitor**.
- **Resizable Borders**: Configurable window borders, useful for visual feedback and resizing.
- **Monitor Focus and Workspace Movement**: Easily switch focus between monitors based on mouse movement and keyboard shortcuts.

### Mouse Actions

- **Move Window**: Hold `Mod` + Left Click to drag a floating window.
- **Resize Window**: Hold `Mod` + Right Click to resize a floating window.
- **Snapping**: Floating windows snap to screen edges when moved close to them.

### Workspace Management

- **Workspaces**: Use `Mod + 1-5` to switch between workspaces. Each monitor has its own set of workspaces.
- **Sticky Windows**: Mark a window as sticky to keep it visible across all workspaces of the monitor.
- **Moving Windows Between Workspaces**: Use `Mod + Shift + [1-5]` to move a window to a different workspace.
- you can increase the number if you want by changing the config 
### Bar Configuration

The status bar displays the active workspaces and the current status. You can update the bar by setting the root window name using the `xsetroot` command. For example:
```bash
xsetroot -name "Hello, World!"
```


### Floating and Tiling Windows

- **Tiling**: Windows are tiled by default in the main workspace. The active window takes up the master area, with other windows stacked.
- **Floating**: Floating windows are always placed on top of tiled windows and can be moved freely between monitors.
- **Fullscreen**: Windows that request fullscreen (like a browser in video fullscreen mode) are handled and displayed accordingly.

### Layouts

The window manager supports the following layouts:

- **Tiling**: Default layout where windows are tiled.
- **Floating**: Windows can be freely moved and resized.
- **Center Master**: The master window is centered, with other windows tiled around it.
- **Grid**: Windows are arranged in a grid layout.

### Window Resizing and Moving

- **Mouse Resizing**: Resize windows with `Mod + Right Click`.
- **Mouse Moving**: Move floating windows with `Mod + Left Click`.
- **Keyboard Resizing**: Resize floating windows using keyboard shortcuts.

## Advanced Configuration

### Fonts

Fonts in the bar are configured using the Fontconfig library. Ensure that you have appropriate fonts installed (e.g., `awesome-font` for icons).

### Customizing the Bar

The status bar is divided into three sections:
- Left: Workspace names `note: ` you can set the names of hte workspaces in the config file but please use one icone becuase the wm doesn't detect the lendth of the name right 
- Right: Custom status (set with `xsetroot`)


You can modify the bar by editing the rendering logic in the source code.
